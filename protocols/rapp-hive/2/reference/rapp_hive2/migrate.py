"""Migration into rapp-hive/2 (experimental frontier) from the versions people run today.

Nothing is rewritten: legacy frames stay exactly as they are and keep working
with their own engines. A migration is a plan (data anyone can review) plus new
frames that each identity signs with its own key. A signer can only ever apply
its own steps; the tool never signs for anyone else.

Path A  rapp-hive/1 -> rapp-hive/2: the one owner becomes the steward founder and
        the policy mirrors rapp-hive/1 (the steward is its only decider), so nothing
        changes until the steward adopts a co-equal policy successor.
Path B  repository-seeded Hives with signed join requests: the exact requests that
        exist at migration are listed in the anchor and are decided under the
        Hive's first policy, so no request is ever stranded.
Path C  a new Hive: no legacy at all.
